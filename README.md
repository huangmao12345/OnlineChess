# OnlineChess
 online chess but with a couple fun features

I coded Chess for the first time in Python, and so now I want to make it in Javascript this time and incorporate it onto a website.

The additional features I plan to add are customizable appearances and ways to play. For example, instead of dragging and dropping a piece to make a move, I will have the option to have a textbox to type in commands either in chess notation or in English.
